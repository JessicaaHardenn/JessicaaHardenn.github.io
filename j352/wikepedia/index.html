        <p>Homer (Dena'ina: Tuggeght) is a city in Kenai Peninsula Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is 218 mi southwest of Anchorage. According to the 2020 Census, the population is 5,522, up from 5,003 in 2010.
            Long
            known as the "Halibut Fishing Capital of the World," Homer is also nicknamed "the end of the road," and more
            recently, "the cosmic hamlet by the sea."</p>

    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>Homer is located at 59°38'35" North, 151°31'33" West (59.643059, -151.525900). The only road into Homer is the
        Sterling Highway.</p>
    <p>Homer is on the shore of Kachemak Bay on the southwest side of the Kenai Peninsula. Its distinguishing feature is
        the Homer Spit, a narrow 4.5 mi long gravel bar that extends into the bay, on which is located the
        Homer Harbor.</p>

    <p>Much of the coastline, as well as the Homer Spit, sank dramatically during the Good Friday earthquake in March
        1964. After the earthquake, very little vegetation was able to survive on the Homer Spit.</p>
    <p>The town has a total area of 25.5 square miles, of which 15 square miles are land and 10.5
        square miles are covered by water.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Tiller digs indicate that early Alutiiq people probably camped in the Homer area, although their villages were on
        the far side of Kachemak Bay.</p>

    <p>Coal was discovered in the area in the 1890s. The Cook Inlet Coal Fields Company built a town, dock, coal mine,
        and railroad at Homer. Coalmining in the area continued until World War II. It is estimated that 400 million
        tons of coal deposits are still present in the area.</p>
    <p>Homer was named for Homer Pennock, a goldmining company promoter, who arrived in 1896 on the Homer Spit and built
        living quarters for his crew of 50 men. However, goldmining was never profitable in the area.</p>
    <p>Another earlier settlement, Miller's Landing, was named after a Charles Miller, who homesteaded in the area
        around 1915. According to local historian Janet Klein, he was an employee of the Alaska Railroad and had
        wintered company horses on the beach grasses on the Homer Spit. He built a landing site in a small bight in
        Kachemak Bay, where supply barges from Seldovia could land and offload their cargos. Miller's landing was
        legally considered a census-designated place separate from Homer until it was annexed in 2002, but has always
        been locally considered part of Homer.</p>
        
    <p>Halibut and salmon sport fishing, along with tourism and commercial fishing are the dominant industries. Homer
        co-hosted the 2006 Arctic Winter Games. The Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and the Kachemak Bay
        Research Reserve co-host a visitor center with interpretive displays known as the Alaska Islands and Ocean
        Visitor Center, and a cultural and historical museum there is called the Pratt Museum.</p>

        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>Homer is the southernmost town on the contiguous Alaska highway system. It is also part of the Alaska Marine
            Highway (the Alaskan ferry system). The regional airport lies near the coast as well, with local air taxis
            and
            regular scheduled commercial flights to Anchorage. Homer erected its first traffic light in 2005.</p>
        <p>The United States Coast Guard currently stations six Island Class cutters in Alaska, including one in Homer.
            From
            February 7, 1992, to June 4, 2015, the USCGC Roanoke Island was assigned to Homer. She was retired early,
            and
            was replaced by the Sapelo. The Sapelo is scheduled to be replaced by a more modern Sentinel-class cutter.
        </p>
        <p>The Coast Guard leases an anchorage on the Homer Spit. The Coast Guard renewed its lease for 20 years in
            2015.
