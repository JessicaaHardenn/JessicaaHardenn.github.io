            <p>With a population of 1.45 million, San Antonio was ranked as the seventh most populous city and was the
                fastest-growing city in terms of numeric population growth in 2021, according to a press release from
                the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>
            <p>
                Larger urban populations lead to an increase in air pollution, but the population-pollution rate is
                different for every city, according to a study done by NASA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though San Antonio’s population increased by 25% since 2000, and larger populations lead to more
                pollution, there was not an overall increase in air pollution.

            <p>The Environmental Protection Agency tracks and regulates six main air pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead,
                nitrogen oxides, ground-level ozone, particle matter and sulfur oxides, according to the agency’s
                website. </p>
            <p>The pollutant levels are recorded using the Air Quality Index (AQI). The index runs on a scale from zero
                to 500 with higher values representing higher concentrations of pollutants, according to the EPA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Values between zero and 50 are classified as good, and values between 51 and 100 are classified as
                moderate, according to the EPA.
            </p>
            <p>
                The EPA tracked ozone, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter in San Antonio
                between 2000 and 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fossil fuel-powdered engines, such as cars and construction equipment, are the highest contributor to
                carbon monoxide levels, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exposure to carbon monoxide reduces oxygen delivery to the body. Lower levels of exposure can cause
                vision problems and reduce manual dexterity; exposure to higher levels can lead to death, according to
                the Texas Commission.

                The yearly average AQI for carbon monoxide in San Antonio has not exceeded 9.6 since 2000, according to
                data from the EPA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carbon monoxide level data was unavailable for the years 2011-2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carbon monoxide levels overall decreased, with small increases in 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2020. The average
                AQI for 2021 was 3.3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nitrogen oxides are formed the same way as carbon monoxide. Short-term exposure can lead to coughing and
                difficulty breathing, but long-term exposure can lead to the development of asthma, according to the
                EPA.

                Nitrogen oxide levels in San Antonio decreased overall since 2000. The highest AQI average was 31 in
                2000 and 2001, and the lowest was 12 in 2011. The yearly AQI average for 2021 was 15, according to data
                from the EPA.

            <p>
                When nitrogen oxides react with volatile organic compounds and sunlight, it creates ground-level ozone.
                Volatile organic compounds are man-made chemicals produced during the manufacturing of paints,
                pharmaceuticals and refrigerants. Exposure to ground-level ozone has similar effects as nitrogen oxides
                and can cause permanent lung damage during long-term exposure, according to the EPA.

                The rate of change in ozone levels in San Antonio was inconsistent. Both 2000 and 2021 had AQI rates of
                45. The average AQI rates for 2002 and 2006 were classified as moderate, and every other year was
                classified as good, according to data from the EPA.

                Fine particulate matter is particles of solids or liquids, such as dust or smoke, in the air that are
                2.5 microns or less in diameter, according to the Texas Commission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Particulate matter can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, but fine particulate matter can get into deep
                parts of the lungs and into the bloodstream. It can cause lung cancer and heart attacks in individuals
                with heart disease, according to the CDC.

                In San Antonio, fine particulate matter is increasing. While the average AQI levels haven’t passed 50,
                they increased from 36 to 47 between 2016 and 2021. Data was unavailable for 2003 and 2004, but there
                wasn’t a steady direction of change between 2000 and 2016, according to data from the EPA.
