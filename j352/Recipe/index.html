    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Roasted cauliflower with lime dressing. Learn how to make the easiest and best-roasted cauliflower with only a
        few steps. Light, crisp, and caramelized, it makes for a delicious vegetarian side dish to any meal.</p>
    <p>Fall is here and the Holiday season is just around the corner. This is the time of year to start assembling all
        your favorite recipes and adding a new one here and there.</p>
    <p>This roasted cauliflower recipe is a winner in my book. Easy to prepare, less than 30 minutes. It can be made the
        day before a big gathering, freeing you to enjoy your company. How fantastic is that?</p>
    <p>I really enjoy roasting vegetables, and cauliflower is one of my favorites to prepare. Easy to work with, and
        foolproof, so many seasonings to play with. An open canvas.</p>
    <p>Our local market had beautiful cauliflower assortments and decided to change things a bit, meaning straying from
        the usual white and this time cook with an orange one. Same flavor, just different color. I guess more festive
        for me.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Cauliflower</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large orange cauliflower head, florets cut off the stump and sliced in half</li>
        <li>1 lime juiced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lime Dressing</h4>

        <li>Juice from 2 limes</li>
        <li>¼ to ⅓ cup of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
